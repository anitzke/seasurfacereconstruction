=================================================================================================

PARAMETERS in configs.txt:

- mode(1): <string>				mode of processing
							(1) "evaluate"	(default)
							(2) "reconstruct"

- candidates: <string>				type of triangle candidates
							- "empty" for Delaunay triangles
							- "kODT" for k-order Delaunay triangles (default)

- ev: <list epochs>/all				training epochs
			
- on: <list epochs>/all				reconstruction epochs

- projection: <string>				projection of the coordinates of TGs and gridded points
							- "", no projection (default)
							- "LCC" for Lambert Conformal Conic projection

- store: <string>				new folder in experiments-folder

- tc: <int>					number of k for k-order Delaunay triangles, only if parameter "candidates" is "kODT"

- rt: <int>					number of months indicating the period of SSA reconstruction based on the training periodonly,
					        only for reconstruction mode,
						for example "-rt: 12" defines the climatological reconstruction

- stationTraining: 				path to the file that contains the tide gauge data for training, only for reconstruction mode

- stationPath: 					path to the file that contains the tide gauge data

- gridDirectory: 				path to the file or folder that contains the altimetry data

- boundingPath: 				optional, path to a file containing coordinates that bound the area of interest


NOTE (1): 
	The program attempts to find some identifier in every point file/for every month in a d35-file. 
	More specifically in non-d35-files it will search for the first "_" in a file name and everything after 
	that except the file extension will be used as a identifier. (e.g. a file named points_january_2018.csv will 
	have the identifier january_2018 in the outputs)
	In the case of a d35-file the months will be used as ids. 
	The identifiers are used to match points to their rasters. For a d35-file that means there has to be a 
	raster file for every month one wants to triangulate. 
	For non-d35-files that means that if there are more than one raster files, the point-files have to have 
	a name that connects them to their raster. Basically the id of a point file has to appear in one of the 
	raster files names. Raster-files and point-files do not have to have the exactly same id. The raster-file name
	just has to contain the id of a point-file. 
	If there is only one raster file every set of points will be processed on that raster.

NOTE (2): 	
	See examples in "configs.txt" for evaluation and "configsRec.txt" for reconstruction.

NOTE (3): 	
	Do not change the order of the last three parameters (stationPath, gridDirectory, boundingPath).

	trainingEpoch_reconstructionEpoch_d.nc:		contains the SSA reconstruction archieved with Delaunay triangulation

reconstructions: (only in reconstruction mode)
	trainingEpoch_reconstructionEpoch_o.nc: 	contains the SSA reconstruction archieved with min-error k-OD triangulation
	
	trainingEpoch_reconstructionEpoch_d.nc:		contains the SSA reconstruction archieved with Delaunay triangulation

simpleAnomalies:
	trainingEpoch_reconstructionEpoch_o.nc: 	contains the misfit of computed SSA by ME k-ODT and reference SSA
	
	trainingEpoch_reconstructionEpoch_d.nc:		contains the misfit of computed SSA by Delaunay T and reference SSA
											
squaredAnomalies:
